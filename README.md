January 2026 challenge: consistent practice, better understanding of data structures & algorithms, and building something small but complete.

## What's inside

- **`problems/`**  
  Daily LeetCode / HackerRank solutions  
  → One file per problem  
  → Includes problem statement (as comment), solution, time/space complexity notes, and sometimes alternative approaches

- **`implementations/`**  
  From-scratch implementations of important data structures  
  → Written for better understanding (no built-in libraries where possible)  
  → Common ones: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, graphs, etc.

- **`project/`**  
  Final mini-project of the month  
  → **To-Do List App** (command-line or simple GUI depending on language choice)

## Goals for January

- Solve at least 20–30 quality problems
- Implement 8–12 core data structures from scratch
- Build one small but functional project
- Write clean, commented code + complexity analysis
- Build the habit of daily coding

## Tech / Languages

- Main language: [add your primary one – e.g. Python / Java / C++]
- Possibly others for comparison/learning

## How to use / explore

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/heliokii/January-StrengthenFundas.git
