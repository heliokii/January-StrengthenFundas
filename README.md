# January-StrengthenFundas
As they say, new year new me. Strengthening core programming fundamentals as a sophomore CS student.

## Folders
- `/problems`: Daily LeetCode/HackerRank solutions (one file per problem, with comments).
- `/implementations`: From-scratch implementations of data structures.
- `/project`: To-Do List App (final January project).
